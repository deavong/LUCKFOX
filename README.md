FreeCAD file for Luckfox Board
This is a FreeCAD design for Luckfox Pico Pro Max Board. 

I recently bought the but was not comfortable of it being nacked, so I developed this enclosure. 
If you have 3D printer, you can just poll the STL file and have it printed. 
I have also included the raw design file, feel free to improve from my novice design.
